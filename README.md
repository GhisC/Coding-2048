# Coding-2048
=== WIP ===
jQuery rush. This project was done during my formation.

## How to use
This program is a jQuery plugin version of the famous 2048 game. 

### Pre-requisites
* JQuery

### HTML structure
Add a div with **"myGame"** id where you want to append the game table.
```html
<div id="myGame"></div>
```

This version is not responsive.
